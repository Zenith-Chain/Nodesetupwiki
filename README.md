- 4 cores of CPU and 16 gigabytes of memory (RAM).
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 10 megabyte per second

#### Validator
- VPS running recent versions of `Linux`.
- IMPORTANT 1T GB of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 3k IOPS, 125MB/S throughput, read latency <1ms. (if start with snap/fast sync, it will need NVMe SSD).
- 8 cores of CPU and 32 gigabytes of memory (RAM).
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 30 megabyte per second
